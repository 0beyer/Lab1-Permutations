Lab Questions:
    1: What is the number of lines of output as a function of n? Explain how you computed it.

    n!, because n! is the amount of permutations that a list of numbers n large has

    2: Based on your timing results and on approximation of the number of lines printed please estimate how long your program would run for n = 15 and for n = 20. Show how you have computed the estimate.

    because n = 8 took 1100 is ms, and n = 9 it took 8700ish ms, we can create a ratio with 
    8450/9!. to get an estimate of n, do (n!*.02329749)
    ratio for our function
    for n = 15, it would take 3.135132e10 ms
    for n = 20, it would take 5.83285038336e16 ms
